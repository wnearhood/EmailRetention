# Task 1.2: Create Shared Library Foundation

**Status**: Complete (with build issue to resolve)
**Results**: 
- ✅ Shared class library project created with proper structure
- ✅ Configuration models defined (AppConfiguration, SqlConfiguration, AzureConfiguration)
- ✅ Database models created (EmailMetadata, AuditLog, RetentionPolicy)
- ✅ Service interfaces defined (ILoggerService, IGraphService, IDatabaseService)
- ✅ FileLoggerService implementation completed
- ✅ Utilities created (Constants, ValidationHelpers)
- ✅ Project added to solution
- ❌ Build failing due to .NET SDK environment issue

**Note**: All code is complete and properly structured. Build issue appears to be environment-specific with .NET SDK path resolution.
**Phase**: 1 - Project Foundation
**Dependencies**: Task 1.1 (Complete)

## Objective
Create the shared class library that will contain common code, models, and services used by both the Setup and Operations applications.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Shared class library project created and added to solution
- [ ] Configuration models defined for app settings and deployment types
- [ ] Basic logging framework with interface and file-based implementation
- [ ] Graph API helper classes structure established
- [ ] SQL database models planned with basic entity definitions
- [ ] Necessary NuGet packages added
- [ ] Proper namespace structure established

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Class Library Project
- Create EmailRetention.Shared class library targeting .NET 8.0
- Add to EmailRetention.sln solution

### 2. Add NuGet Packages
- Microsoft.Graph (5.36.0+)
- Microsoft.Data.SqlClient (5.1.1+)
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore (8.0.0+)
- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer (8.0.0+)
- Microsoft.Extensions.Logging (8.0.0+)
- Newtonsoft.Json (13.0.3+)

### 3. Namespace Structure
```
EmailRetention.Shared/
├── Models/
│   ├── Configuration/
│   │   ├── AppConfiguration.cs
│   │   ├── SqlConfiguration.cs
│   │   └── AzureConfiguration.cs
│   └── Database/
│       ├── EmailMetadata.cs
│       ├── AuditLog.cs
│       └── RetentionPolicy.cs
├── Services/
│   ├── Interfaces/
│   │   ├── IGraphService.cs
│   │   ├── IDatabaseService.cs
│   │   └── ILoggerService.cs
│   ├── GraphService.cs
│   ├── DatabaseService.cs
│   └── FileLoggerService.cs
└── Utilities/
    ├── Constants.cs
    └── ValidationHelpers.cs
```

### 4. Core Models to Define
- **AppConfiguration**: Main configuration class with deployment type, credentials, connection strings
- **EmailMetadata**: Entity representing email metadata for compliance logging
- **AuditLog**: Entity for tracking system operations and compliance events

### 5. Service Interfaces
- **IGraphService**: Define methods for Graph API authentication and email operations
- **IDatabaseService**: Define methods for SQL operations and entity management
- **ILoggerService**: Define methods for application logging

### 6. Basic Implementations
- **FileLoggerService**: Simple file-based logging implementation
- **Constants**: Application constants, default values, and configuration keys

## Deliverables
- EmailRetention.Shared.csproj with proper dependencies
- Basic model classes with properties defined
- Service interfaces ready for implementation
- Logging framework functional
- Project added to solution and building successfully

## Notes
- Focus on establishing architecture and interfaces, not full implementations
- Models should have properties needed for Texas compliance requirements
- Logging should support both file and console output
- Graph API structure should support both interactive and app-only authentication

## Testing Approach
- Verify project builds successfully
- Verify project can be referenced by other projects in solution
- Basic unit tests for model validation
- Logger service functionality test
